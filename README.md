# Pine-Valley-Furniture-Report
Creation of a Data Ware House for a Pine Valley Furniture Company. We moved the transactional data from the Oracle Data Base to Data Ware house which is again a Oracle Data BAse environment. We performed extraction, transformation and loading using Informatica Tool along with the basic SQL queries to transfer data to analytical environment. Later we performed the data query to validate the operations that we could perform using data ware house. Simply say, Business Intelligence operations.
